                FIRST MINI PROJECT
===============================================================================

Using all the tools as they were being taught to create the index.html and 
main.css file

I will say there are too many commands to type, the tutor was a bit fast which
made me go back a few times.

All in all, I felt it was a good course.

Trying to keep git'ing it so I get used to it.
